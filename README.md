# NETFLIX-INTRO-ANIMATION

IN THIS PROJECT MODULE WE WILL BE CREATING A SIMPLE NETFLIX INTO ANIMATION BY JUST USING CSS. THE STEPS TO CREATE IT IS AS FOLLOWS :-
1) OPEN VS CODE.
2) COPY THE EXACT SAME HTML FILE AND CSS FILE.
3) SAVE AND CLICK ON GO LIVE EXTENSION ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF THE SCREEN.

A NEW BROWSER WINDOW WITH OUR DESIRED OUTPUT WILL APPEAR. ENJOY!
